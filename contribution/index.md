# Contributing Guidelines

To contribute, there's a lot of tips and tricks with GitHub that are essential for writing and contributing, along with specific guidelines and rules for the formatting of the Markdown files and the entire wiki.  
  
If you don't want to write any articles, but find issues (or want something to be clearer), feel free to make an issue and cite the specific page and line, any contributions (issues included) are always helpful!

To make a new directory, type `/` after the name in the file name area. After that, name the file either index.md for the home page for that plugin, and then the following topics inside aftre the name of the topics.  

  
## Writing with Markdown
  
`#` creates a large title  
`##` creates a medium title (category in table of contents)  
`###` creates a small title (subcategory in table of contents)  
`**text**` creates bold text  
`*text*` creates italic text  
`> text` creates a blockquote  
`[text](URL)` creates a link  
`[ ]` creates an unchecked box  
`[X]` creates a checked box  
``text`` creates a small code line (good for commands)  

With text (formatted or not) to create a new line add two extra spaces at the end of the line.

You can paste images into GitHub's text editor and it'll automatically create an image element for you.
